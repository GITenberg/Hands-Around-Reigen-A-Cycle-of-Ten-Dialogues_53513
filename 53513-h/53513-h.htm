<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Humanity seems gayest when dancing on the
brink of a volcano. The culture of a period preceding
a social cataclysm is marked by a spirit of
light wit and sophisticated elegance which finds
expression in a literature of a distinct type. This
literature is light-hearted, audacious and self-conscious.
It can treat with the most charming insouciance
subjects which in another age would have
been awkward or even vulgar. But with the riper
experience of a period approaching its end the
writers feel untrammeled in the choice of theme by
pride or prejudice knowing that they will never
transgress the line of good taste.</p>

<p>So it was in the declining days of the Roman
civilization when Lucian of Samosata wrote his
<cite>Dialogues of the Hetærai</cite> and countless poets
penned their intricate epigrams on the art and experience
of love. So it was in England when the
fine vigor of the Elizabethan and Miltonic age gave
way to the Restoration and the calculating brilliance
of a Congreve or a Wycherly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>But the exquisite handling of the licentious was
elaborated into a perfect technique in eighteenth
century France. The spirit of the Rococo with its
predilection for the well-measured pose was singularly
well adapted to the artistic expression of what
in a cruder age could only have been voiced with
coarseness and vulgarity. In the literature of this
period we meet again the spirit that animates the
gracious paintings of Watteau and Fragonard.
The scenes we admire in their panels recur in literary
style in works like Choderlos de Laclos’
<cite>Liaisons dangereuses</cite> and Louvet de Couvray’s <cite>Les
amours du Chevalier de Faublas</cite>. Again the same
note is heard in Beaumarchais’ <cite>Le Mariage de
Figaro</cite>, in which the society of the period is travestied
with brilliant wit and worldly philosophy.
The court of Louis XVI., quite unaware, looked on
and applauded a play which Napoleon later characterized
as “the revolution already in action.”</p>

<p>During the closing years of the nineteenth century
a similar spirit has hovered over Vienna,
when it was the last and staunchest stronghold of
aristocracy in the modern world. Its literature reflected
the charm of a fastidious amatory etiquette
which is forbidden in sterner and soberer environment,
while it gayly ignored the slow gathering of
the clouds which foreshadowed its own catastrophe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
and martyrdom. As Percival Pollard once so well
put it: “All that rises out of that air has had fascination,
grace, insinuation, and intrigue. Neither
tremendous passion nor tremendous problems have
stirred, to all appearances, these polite artists of
Vienna. Passion might be there, but what was to
be artistically expressed was, rather, the witty or
ironically mournful surfaces of passion.”</p>

<p>The literary master of this world is concededly
Arthur Schnitzler, in whom are curiously combined
the sophisticated elegance of the Viennese man of
letters and the disenchanting wisdom of the practising
physician. He was born in Vienna in 1862,
the son of a doctor. He studied medicine himself,
took his degree in 1885, and was for two years connected
with a hospital. Since then he has practised
privately, and has also found the time to write
a long series of plays, both in prose and verse,
several novels, and many shorter stories. Of
these a considerable number have appeared in
English.</p>

<p><cite>Reigen</cite>, here translated as <cite>Hands Around</cite>, is a
series of ten comedies—miniatures in dialogue
between man and woman in various ages and walks
of life. But transgressing the merely literary they
are psychological studies of the interplay of sex,
and keen analyses of the sophisticated modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
soul, done with freedom and finesse. There are
no grim questions of right and wrong in these subtle
revelations of the merely human. In fact one
might call them studies in the etiquette of the liaison
and all its nuances.</p>

<p>The cycle begins with a girl of the streets and a
soldier. Then come the soldier and a parlor-maid,
the parlor-maid and a young man, the young man
and a young wife, the young wife and her husband,
the husband and a sweet young miss, the sweet
young miss and a poet, the poet and an actress, the
actress and a count, until finally the cycle is completed
with the count and the girl of the streets.
A vicious circle, some may say, and such it surely
would have been in the hands of a lesser artist than
Schnitzler, for he would only have made the book
hideously fleshly, instead of a marvelous psychological
study in the ecstacies and disillusions of
love and the whole tragedy of human wishes unsatisfied
even in their apparent gratification.</p>

<p>But as it is the silken portières of discreet alcoves
are opened quietly before our eyes, and we
hear the whisper of the most intimate secrets. But
with all their realism there is no word in these dialogues
which could antagonize the susceptibilities
of any sincere student or true lover of humanity.
All stratagems of sex are uncovered not through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
the curious observations of a faunic mind, but
through the finer eyes of a connoisseur of things
human.</p>

<p>The Puritan fanatic with his jaundiced inhibitions
or the moral ideologist with his heart of
leather may toss the book aside resentful because
of its inherent truth. The philosopher of human
life, taking the larger aspect of this drama, will
close it with the serene smile of understanding.</p>

<p>Any attempt to turn a dialogue so full of delicate
shades as is this of Schnitzler into a language like
English, whose genius tends rather toward a graphic
concreteness and realism, is full of pitfalls and
difficulties. The translators, however, hope that
they have accomplished their task with reasonable
success, thinking always of the spirit rather than
the letter. They also take this occasion to express
their appreciation to Dr. Arthur Schnitzler for his
kindness in granting them his authorization for this
translation of <cite>Reigen</cite>.</p>

<h2>THE GIRL OF THE STREETS AND THE
SOLDIER</h2>

<p class="scene">Late in the evening near the Augarten Bridge.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Enters whistling, on his way home</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Hello, my beautiful angel!</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Turns and continues on his way</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Don’t you want to come with me?</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Oh, I am the beautiful angel?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Sure, who else? Do come with me. I live very
near here.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>I’ve no time. I must get back to the barracks.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>You’ll get to your barracks in plenty of time.
It’s much nicer with me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Close to her</span>) That’s possible.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Ps-st! A guard may pass any minute.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Rot! A guard! I carry a saber too!</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Ah, come with me.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Let me alone. I have no money anyway.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>I don’t want any money.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Stopping. They are under a street-lamp</span>)
You don’t want any money? What kind of a girl
are you, then?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>The civilians pay me. Chaps like you don’t
have to pay me for anything.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Maybe you’re the girl my pal told me about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>I don’t know any pal of yours.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>You’re she, all right! You know—in the café
down the street—He went home with you from
there.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Lots have gone home with me from that café…
Oh, lots!</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>All right. Let’s go!</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>So, you’re in a hurry now?</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Well, what are we waiting for? Anyhow, I must
be back at the barracks by ten.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Been in service long?</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>What business is that of yours? Is it far?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Ten minutes’ walk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>That’s too far for me. Give me a kiss.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Kissing him</span>) I like that best anyway—when
I love some one.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>I don’t. No, I can’t go with you. It’s too far.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Say, come to-morrow afternoon.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Sure. Give me your address.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>But maybe you won’t come.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>If I promise!</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Look here—if my place is too far to-night—there
… there…</p>

<p class="indented">(<span class="stage-direction">She points toward the Danube</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>What’s there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>It’s nice and quiet there, too … no one is
around.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Oh, that’s not the real thing.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>It’s always the real thing with me. Come, stay
with me now. Who knows, if we’ll be alive to-morrow.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Come along then—but quick.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Be careful! It’s dark here. If you slip, you’ll
fall in the river.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Would be the best thing, perhaps.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Sh-h. Wait a minute. We’ll come to a bench
soon.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>You seem to know this place pretty well.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>I’d like to have you for a sweetheart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>I’d fight too much.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>I’d cure you of that soon enough.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Humph—</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Don’t make so much noise. Sometimes a guard
stumbles down here. Would you believe we are
in the middle of Vienna?</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Come here. Come over here.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>You are crazy! If we slipped here, we’d fall
into the river.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Has grabbed her</span>) Oh you—</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Hold tight to me.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid…</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>It would have been nicer on the bench.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Here or there, it doesn’t matter to me…
Well, pick yourself up.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>What’s your hurry—?</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>I must get to the barracks. I’ll be late anyhow.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Say, what’s your name?</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>What’s that to you?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>My name is Leocadia.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Humph! I never heard such a name before.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Listen!</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Well, what do you want?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Give me just a dime for the janitor.</p>

<h2>THE SOLDIER AND THE
PARLOR-MAID</h2>

<p class="scene">Prater Gardens. Sunday Evening. A road
which leads from the Wurstelprater<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> into dark tree
arcades. Confused music from the Wurstelprater
can still be heard; also strains from the cheap
dancehall, a vulgar polka, played by a brass band.
<span class="character">The Soldier.</span> <span class="character">The Parlor-Maid.</span></p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>Now tell me why you wanted to leave.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Grins sheepishly</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>It was so beautiful and I so love to dance.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Puts his arm around her waist</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Submitting</span>) But we aren’t dancing now.
Why do you hold me so tight?</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>What’s your name? Katy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>You’ve always got a “Katy” on your mind.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>I know—I know … Marie.</p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>Goodness, it’s dark here. I’m afraid.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>You needn’t be afraid when I’m with you. I
can take care of myself!</p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>But where are we going? There’s no one
around. Come, let’s go back!… It’s so dark!</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Pulling at his cigar until it glows brightly</span>)
There … it’s already getting brighter. Ha—!
Oh, you dearie!</p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>Oh! what are you doing there? If I had known
this before!</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>The devil take me, if any one at the dance to-day
felt softer and rounder than you, Miss Marie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>Did you find it out in the same way with all the

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>You notice things … dancing. You find out
lots that way!</p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>But you danced much oftener with that cross-eyed
blonde than with me.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>She’s an old friend of one of my pals.</p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>Of the corporal with the upturned mustache?</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Oh no, I mean the civilian. You know, the one
who was talking with me at the table in the beginning.
The one who has such a husky voice.</p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>Oh I know. He’s fresh.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Did he do anything to you? I’ll show him!
What did he do to you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>Oh nothing… I only noticed how he was with
the others.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Tell me, Miss Marie…</p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>You’ll burn me with your cigar.</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Pardon me!—Miss Marie—or may I say Marie?</p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>We’re not such good friends yet…</p>

<p>There’re many who don’t like each-other, and yet

should come!</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>What if some one did come? They couldn’t
see anything two steps off.</p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>For goodness’ sake, where are we going?</p>

<p class="character">Soldier</p>

<p>Look! There’s two just like us.</p>

<p>Well, I mean, they like each other too.</p>

<p>So? Then we go the same way … but it’s
still too early for me … me for the dance…
I’ve got late leave to-day… I don’t need to be
back at the barracks before twelve o’clock. I’m
going to dance.</p>

<h2>THE PARLOR MAID AND THE
YOUNG MAN</h2>

<p class="scene">Sultry summer afternoon. The parents of the
<span class="character">Young Man</span> are away in the country. The cook
has gone out. The <span class="character">Parlor-maid</span> is in the kitchen
writing a letter to the soldier who is now her sweetheart.
The <span class="character">Young Man’s</span> bell rings. She gets up
and goes to his room. The <span class="character">Young Man</span> is lying on
a couch, smoking a cigarette and reading a French
novel.</p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>Yes, Sir?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Oh, yes, Marie, oh, yes; I rang, yes … I only
wanted … yes, of course… Oh, yes, of
course, let the blinds down, Marie… It’s cooler
with the blinds down … yes…</p>

<p class="indented">(<span class="stage-direction">The <span class="character">Maid</span> goes to the window and pulls
down the blinds</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Continues reading</span>) What are you doing,
Marie? Oh, yes. But, now, I can’t see to read.</p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>You are always so studious, Sir.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>I say, Marie … let’s see, what was it I wanted
to say? … oh, yes… Is there any cognac in
the house?</p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>Yes, but it’s locked up.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Well, who has the key?</p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>Lini.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Who is Lini?</p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>The cook, Mr. Alfred.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Well, then ask Lini for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>Yes, but it’s Lini’s day out.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>So…</p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>Can I get anything for you from the café, Sir?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Thank you, no… It is hot enough as it is. I
don’t need any cognac. Listen, Marie, bring me
a glass of water. Wait, Marie,—let it run, till it
gets quite cold.</p>

<p class="indented stage-direction">Exit <span class="character">Maid</span>. The <span class="character">Young Man</span> gazes
after her. At the door the <span class="character">Maid</span> looks back
at him, and the <span class="character">Young Man</span> glances into
the air. The <span class="character">Maid</span> turns on the water and
lets it run. Meanwhile, she goes into her
room, washes her hands, and arranges her
curls before the mirror. Then she brings
the glass of water to the <span class="character">Young Man</span>. She
approaches the couch. The <span class="character">Young Man</span>
raises himself upon his elbow. The <span class="character">Maid</span>
gives him the glass of water and their fingers
touch.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Thank you—Well, what is the matter?—Be careful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Put the glass back on the tray. (<span class="stage-direction">He leans

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Remains stretched out awhile; then, suddenly,
he gets up. He walks to the door, back again, and

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Appears with a smile which she does not try to

<p>Listen, Marie, there was something I wanted to
ask you. Didn’t Dr. Schueller call this morning?</p>

<p>No, Sir, nobody called this morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>That is strange. Then, Dr. Schueller didn’t call.
Do you know Dr. Schueller by sight?</p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>Of course, I do. He’s the big gentleman with
the black beard.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Yes. Then, perhaps, he called after all?</p>

<p class="character">Maid</p>

<p>No, Sir. Nobody called.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Resolutely</span>) Come here, Marie.</p>

<p>Do you want anything, Sir?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

your blouse … what kind of a blouse is it …
can’t you come closer. I won’t bite you.</p>

<h2>THE YOUNG MAN AND THE
YOUNG WIFE</h2>

<p class="scene">Evening—A drawing-room furnished with cheap
elegance in a house in Schwind street. The <span class="character">Young
Man</span> has just come in; and, still wearing his hat
and overcoat, he lights the gas. Then he opens a
door to a side-room and looks in. The light from
the drawing-room shimmers over the inlaid floor
as far as the Louis Quinze bed, which stands against
the opposite wall. A reddish light plays from the
fire-place in the corner of the bedroom upon the
hangings of the bed. The <span class="character">Young Man</span> now inspects
the bedroom. He takes an atomizer from
the dressing-table, and sprays the bed-pillows with
a fine rain of violet perfume. Then he carries the
atomizer through both rooms, constantly pressing
upon the bulb, so that soon the odor of violets pervades
the place. He then takes off his hat and
coat. He sits down in a blue velvet armchair,
lights a cigarette, and smokes. After a short pause
he rises again, and makes sure that the green shutters
are closed. Suddenly, he goes into the bedroom,
and opens a drawer in the dressing-table.
He puts his hand in it, and finds a tortoise-shell
hair-pin. He looks for a place to hide it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
finally puts it into a pocket of his overcoat. He
opens the buffet in the drawing-room; takes a silver
tray, with a bottle and two liqueur glasses, and puts
them on the table. He goes back to his overcoat,
and takes from it a small white package. Opening
this, he places it beside the cognac. He goes again
to the buffet, and takes two small plates and knives
and forks. He takes a candied chestnut from the
package and eats it. Then he pours himself a
glass of cognac, and drinks it quickly. He then
looks at his watch. He walks up and down the
room. He stops a while before a large mirror,
ordering his hair and small mustache with a pocket-comb.
He next goes to the door of the vestibule
and listens. Nothing is stirring. Then he closes
the blue portières, which hang before the bedroom.
The bell rings. He starts slightly. Then he sits
down in the armchair, and rises only when the door
has been opened and the <span class="character">Young Wife</span> enters.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Heavily veiled, closes the door behind her,
pausing a moment with her left hand over her heart,

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Goes toward her, takes her left hand, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Alfred—Alfred!</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Come, Madame… Come, Emma…</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Let me be for a minute—please … oh, please,
please, Alfred!</p>

<p class="indented">(<span class="stage-direction">She is still standing at the door</span>)</p>

<p>Where am I?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>With me.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>This house is terrible, Alfred.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Why terrible? It is a very proper house.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>But I met two gentlemen on the staircase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Acquaintances of yours?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>I don’t know. It’s possible.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>But, Madame—You surely know your friends!</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>I couldn’t see their faces.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>But even had they been your best friends—they
couldn’t possibly have recognized you… I, myself
… if I didn’t know it was you … this
veil—</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>There are two.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Won’t you come closer?… And take off
your hat, at least?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>What are you thinking of, Alfred? I promised
you: Five minutes… Not a moment more
… I swear it, no more—</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Well, then, your veil—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>There are two of them.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Very well, both of them—you will at least let me
see your face.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Do you really love me, Alfred?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Deeply hurt</span>) Emma! You ask me…</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>It’s so warm here.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>You’re still wearing your fur-coat—really, you
will catch cold.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Finally enters the room, and throws herself into

<p>You’ve never been so beautiful.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Gets up</span>) You still have your coat on.</p>

<p>The five minutes are long past.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Not one yet!—</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Alfred, tell me truly now, how late it is.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>It is now exactly a quarter past six.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>I should have been at my sister’s long ago.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>You can see your sister any time…</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Oh, Merciful Heaven, Alfred, why did you tempt
me to come?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Because … I adore you, Emma!</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>To how many have you said the same thing?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Since I met you, to no one.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>What a foolish woman I am! If anybody had
predicted … just a week ago … or even yesterday…</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>But you had already promised me the day before
yesterday.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>You plagued me so. But I didn’t want to do it.
God is my witness—I didn’t want to do it…
Yesterday, I was firmly decided… Do you know
I even wrote you a long letter last night?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>I didn’t receive any.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>I tore it up later. Oh, if only I had sent it to
you.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>It is better as it is.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Oh, no, it’s awful … of me. I don’t understand
myself. Good-by, Alfred, let me go.</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Seizes her, and covers her face with burning

<p>Alfred—Alfred, what are you doing to me!</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Wasn’t I right?—It isn’t so awfully uncomfortable
here… And we are so safe here. It’s a
thousand times better than those meetings outdoors…</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Oh, don’t remind me of them.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>I shall always recall them with a thousand delights.

you is a sweet memory.</p>

<p>Do you remember the ball at the Manufacturers’

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Do I remember it…? I sat beside you
through the whole supper—quite close to you.
Your husband had champagne…</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Looks at him with a hurt expression</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>I meant to speak only of the champagne.
Emma, would you like a glass of cognac?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Only a drop, but first give me a glass of water.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Surely… But where is—oh, yes, I remember…</p>

<p class="indented">(<span class="stage-direction">Pours her a glass of water</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Now I’m going to ask you something, Alfred—and
you must tell me the truth.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>I swear—</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Has there ever been any other woman in these
rooms?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>But, Emma—this house was built twenty years
ago!—</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>You know what I mean, Alfred … in these
rooms, with you!</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>With me—here—Emma!—It’s not kind of you
even to imagine such a thing.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Then there was … how shall I… But, no,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
I’d rather not ask. It is better that I shouldn’t ask.
It’s my own fault. Every fault has its punishment.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>But what is wrong? What is the matter with
you? What fault?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>No, no, no, I mustn’t think… Otherwise I
would sink through the floor with shame.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">With the water-bottle in his hand, shakes his

hurt me.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Pours a glass of cognac</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>I want to tell you something, Emma. If you’re
ashamed of being here—if you don’t care for me—if
you don’t feel you are all the happiness in the
world for me—then you’d better go.—</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Yes, I shall go.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Taking hold of her hand</span>) But if you feel that
I cannot live without you, that a kiss upon your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
hand means more to me than all the caresses of all
the women in the whole world… Emma, I’m
not like other young men, who are experienced in
love-making—perhaps, I am too naïve …
I…</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>But suppose you were like other young men?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Then you wouldn’t be here to-night—because
you are not like other women.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>How do you know that?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Drawing her close beside him on the sofa</span>)</p>

<p>I have thought a lot about it. I know you are unhappy.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Pleased</span>) Yes.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Life is so dreary, so empty—and then,—so short—so
horribly short! There is only one happiness—to
find some one who loves you.—</p>

<p>Apparently I love you too much … yes…

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>… …</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>I have been beside myself all these days. I was
afraid of this.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Don’t mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Oh, certainly not. It’s perfectly natural, if
one…</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>No … don’t… You are nervous. Calm
yourself first.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Do you know Stendhal?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Stendhal?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>The “Psychologie de l’amour.”</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>No. Why do you ask me?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>There’s a story in that book which is very much
to the point.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>What kind of a story?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>There is a gathering of cavalry officers—</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>And they are telling each other about their love
affairs. And each one of them tells that with the
woman he loved best—most passionately, you know
… that with him, that then—well, in short, that
the same thing happened just as it happened to me
now.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>That is very characteristic.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>The story is not yet ended. One of them maintained
… that this thing had never in his life
happened to him, but, adds Stendhal—he was
known as a great boaster.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>And.—</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>And, yet, it makes you feel blue—that’s the
stupid side of it, even though it’s so unimportant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Of course. Anyway, you know … you
promised me to be good.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Sh-h! Don’t laugh. That doesn’t help things
any.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>But no, I’m not laughing. That story of Stendhal’s
is really interesting. I have always thought
that only older people … or people who …
you know, people who have lived fast…</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>The idea! That has nothing to do with it. By
the way, I had completely forgotten the prettiest of
Stendhal’s stories. One of the cavalry officers
went so far as to say that he stayed for three or
even six nights… I don’t remember now—that
is he stayed with a woman, whom he wanted for
weeks—<i lang="fr">desirée</i>—you understand—and nothing
happened all those nights except that they wept for
happiness … both…</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Both?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Yes. Does that surprise you? It seems very
comprehensible—especially when two people love
each other.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>But surely there are many who don’t weep.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Nervously</span>) Certainly … however, that is
an exceptional case.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Oh—I thought Stendhal said that all cavalry officers
weep on such an occasion.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Look here, now you are laughing at me.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>What an idea! Don’t be childish, Alfred.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Well, it makes me nervous anyway… Besides
I have the feeling that you are thinking about
it all the time. That embarrasses me still more.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>I’m not thinking of it at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>If I were only sure that you love me.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Do you want still further proofs?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Didn’t I tell you … you are always laughing
at me.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>How so? Come, let me hold your sweet little
head.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Oh, that feels so good.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Do you love me?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Oh, I’m so happy.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>But you needn’t cry about it.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Moving away from her, highly irritated</span>)
There! Again! I begged you not to…</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>To tell you that you shouldn’t cry…</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>You said: “You needn’t cry about it.”</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>You are nervous, sweetheart.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>I know.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>But you ought not to be. It is beautiful even
that … that we are together like good comrades…</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Now you are beginning again.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Don’t you remember! That was one of our first
talks. We wanted to be comrades, nothing more.
Oh, how nice that was … at my sister’s ball in
January, during the quadrille… For heaven’s
sake, I should have gone long ago… My sister
expects me—what shall I tell her… Good-by,
Alfred—</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Emma!—You will leave me in this way!</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Yes—so!—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Five minutes more…</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>All right. Five minutes more. But you must
promise me … not to move?… Yes?…
I want to give you a good-by kiss… Psst …
be still … don’t move, I told you, otherwise I’ll
get up at once, you, my sweetheart, sweet…</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Emma … my ador… …</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>My Alfred!</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Oh, it is heaven to be with you.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>But now I’ve really got to go.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Oh, let your sister wait.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>I must go home. It is much too late to see my
sister. How late is it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>How should I know?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>You might look at your watch.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>My watch is in my waistcoat.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Get it.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Gets up with a jump</span>) Eight o’clock.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Jumps up quickly</span>) For heaven’s sake…
Quick, Alfred, give me my stockings. What shall
I say? They must be waiting for me at home …
eight o’clock…</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>When shall I see you again?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Never.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Emma! Don’t you love me any more?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Just for that reason. Give me my shoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Never again? Here are your shoes.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>My button-hook is in my bag. Please, be
quick…</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Here is the button-hook.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Alfred, this may cost us our lives.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Unpleasantly moved</span>) In what way?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>What shall I say, if he asks me where I’ve been?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>At your sister’s.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Oh, if I only could lie.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Well, you’ll have to.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Everything for a man like you. Oh, come
here … let me give you a last kiss. (<span class="stage-direction">She embraces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
him</span>)—And now—leave me by myself, go
in the other room.—I can’t dress, if you are around.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Goes into the drawing-room, where he dresses.
He eats some pastry and drinks a glass of cognac</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Calls after a while</span>) Alfred!</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Yes, sweetheart.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Isn’t it better that we didn’t weep?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Smiling, not without pride</span>) How can you talk
so frivolously?—</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Oh, how difficult it will be now—if we should
meet by chance in company?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>By chance?—sometime?… Surely you are
coming to Lobheimer’s to-morrow?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Yes. You too?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Of course. May I ask for the cotillion?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Oh, I shall not go. What do you imagine?—I
would… (<span class="stage-direction">She enters the drawing-room fully
dressed, and takes a piece of chocolate pastry</span>) sink
through the floor.</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>To-morrow at Lobheimer’s. That’s fine.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>No, no… I shall decline … certainly decline—</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Well, the day after to-morrow … here.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>The idea!</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>At six…</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>There are cabs at this corner, aren’t there?</p>

<p class="character">Young Man</p>

<p>Yes, as many as you want. Well, the day after
to-morrow, here at six o’clock. Please say “yes,”
sweetheart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Well then, to-morrow night at Lobheimer’s, and

<h2>THE YOUNG WIFE AND
THE HUSBAND</h2>

<p class="scene">A comfortable bedroom. It is half past ten at
night. The <span class="character">Wife</span> is lying abed and reading. The
<span class="character">Husband</span> enters the room in a dressing gown.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Without looking up</span>) You have stopped working?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Yes. I’m too tired. And besides…</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Well?—</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>I felt so lonely at my desk all at once. A longing
for you came over me.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Looking up</span>) Really?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Sitting down on the bed beside her</span>) Don’t
read any more to-night. You will ruin your eyes.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Closing the book</span>) What’s the matter with
you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Nothing, child. I’m in love with you. But you
know that.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>One might almost forget it sometimes.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>One <em>must</em> forget it sometimes.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Because, otherwise, marriage would be something
imperfect. It would … how shall I express it
… it would lose its sanctity.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Oh…</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Believe me—it is so… If we hadn’t sometimes
forgotten that we are in love with each other
during the five years we have been married—we
might not be in love any longer.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>That’s beyond me.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>The case is simply this. We have had perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
ten or twelve love-affairs with each other…
Doesn’t it seem that way to you, too?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>I haven’t counted them!</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>If we had enjoyed the first one to the last drop,
if I had from the very beginning surrendered without
restraint to my passion for you, the same thing
would have happened to us that has happened to
millions of other lovers. We would be tired of
each other.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Ah … do you mean that?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Believe me—Emma—in the early days of our
marriage, I was afraid that this would happen.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>I, too.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>See? Am I not right? Therefore, it is wise
every now and then to live only as good friends.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Oh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>And some can always experience new honeymoons,
especially since I am careful never to let
such weeks of honeymoon…</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Run into months.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>That is true.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>And now … now it seems we are at the end
of another such period of friendship—?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Pressing her tenderly to him</span>) So it might
seem.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>But if … if I should feel differently?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>You couldn’t. You are the wisest and most delicious
being in the world. I am very happy to
have found you.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>You know how to make love very well—every
now and then.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Who has also gone to bed</span>) Well, for a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
who has looked about in the world a bit—come,
lay your head on my shoulder—who has seen something
of the world, marriage is really something
much more mysterious than it is for you sheltered
young girls. You come to us entirely innocent
and … to a certain degree, at least, ignorant of
things, and therefore you really understand the
essence of love much better than we.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Laughing</span>) Oh!</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Certainly. For we get all tangled up by the
many experiences that we have to go through before
marriage. You women, of course, hear a lot
of things, you know a lot of things, no doubt read
too much, but you can’t have any real idea of the
things men experience. We men really become
quite disgusted with this thing people call love, for
the kind of creatures to which we are restricted
really are…</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Tell me—what kind of creatures are they?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Kissing her on the forehead</span>) You ought to be
glad, dear child, that you never have had a glimpse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of relations like that. After all most of the poor
things deserve pity—it is not for us to throw stones.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>But—this pity—it doesn’t seem quite appropriate
to me.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">With gentle benevolence</span>) They deserve it.
You young girls of good family, who wait quietly
under the care of your parents for the man who desires
you in marriage,—you won’t know the misery
that drives most of these poor creatures into the
arms of sin.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Do all of them really sell themselves?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>I would hardly say that. I don’t mean the material
misery alone. There is also—one might
call it—a moral misery, a lack of appreciation for
what is permissible, and, especially, for what is
noble.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>But why are they to be pitied?—They seem to
enjoy themselves.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>You have strange ideas, my child. You must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
not forget that such people are predestined by nature
to sink lower and lower. There is no stopping
them.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Cuddling to him</span>) It seems pleasant to fall.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Hurt</span>) How can you say things like that,
Emma? I should think that to good women like
you, nothing could be more repulsive than those
who are not!</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Of course, Karl, of course. I was just thinking.
Go on, tell me more. I like it when you talk like
this. Tell me something.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>What?—</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Why—about these people.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>The idea!</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>But, I asked you a long time ago—you know,
when we were first married to tell me something of
your younger days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Why does that interest you?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Aren’t you my husband? Isn’t it a sort of injustice
that I really know nothing about your past?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>You surely don’t think I have such bad taste,
as to—No, Emma … it would be like a profanation.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>And yet you have … heaven knows how many
other women you have held in your arms, just as
you are holding me now.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Don’t say “women.” You are <em>the</em> woman.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>But you must answer one question … otherwise
… otherwise … there won’t be any
honeymoon.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>That’s a nice way to talk … remember you
are a mother … our little girl is sleeping in
there…</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Snuggling against him</span>) But I want a boy, too.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Emma!</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Don’t be silly … of course, I am your wife
… but I’d like also to be … to be your sweetheart.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Would you?…</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Well—now my question.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Accommodating</span>) All right.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Was there … a married woman … amongst
them?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Why? What do you mean?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>You know what I mean.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Slightly disconcerted</span>) What makes you think
of a thing like that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>I would like to know if … I mean—there are
such women… I know that very well. But did
you?…</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Seriously</span>) Do you know such a woman?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Well, I hardly know.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Is there, perhaps, such a woman among your
friends?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>How can I be sure that there is—or that there
isn’t?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Did any of your friends … women talk about
a lot of things—alone among themselves—did any
of them ever confess—?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Uncertainly</span>) No.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Do you suspect any of your friends—that
she…</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Suspect … oh … suspect.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>It would seem so.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>No, indeed, Karl, most certainly not. When I
think things over—I don’t believe there is any one.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>No one?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Not among my friends.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Promise me something, Emma.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>That you will never associate with a woman about
whom you have the slightest suspicion that she …
doesn’t lead a completely blameless life.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>And you think it necessary for me to promise
that?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>I know that you will not seek out the company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of such women. But, it might happen that you
… in fact it often happens that such women,
whose reputations are not of the best, seek out good
women, partly to give them standing, and partly
because they feel … how shall I say?… because
they feel a certain homesickness for virtue.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Do they?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Yes. I believe what I just said is very true.
Homesickness for virtue. For all of these women
are at heart very unhappy; you can believe that.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>You ask me, Emma?—How can you even ask?—Just
imagine what a life these women lead!
Full of lies, perfidy, vulgarity, and danger.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Yes, of course. You are right.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Truly … they pay for their little happiness
… their little…</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Pleasure.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Why “pleasure”? Why do you call it “pleasure”?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Well,—there must be something in it—! Otherwise,
they wouldn’t do it.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>It is nothing … an intoxication.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Pensively</span>) An intoxication…</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>No, it is not even intoxication. Like everything—it
is dearly paid for, that much is certain.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Well … it has happened to you, hasn’t it?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Yes, Emma.—And it is the thing I most regret.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Who was she? Tell me! Do I know her?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>The idea!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Was it long ago? Was it very long before you
married me?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Don’t ask me. Please, don’t ask.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>But, Karl!</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>She is dead.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Are you in earnest?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Yes … it sounds almost ridiculous, but I have
the feeling that all such women die young.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Did you love her very much?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>One doesn’t love women who lie.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Then why…</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>An intoxication…</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Don’t talk about it any more, please. All that
is passed long ago. I have only loved one woman—that
is you. You only love where there is purity
and truth.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Karl!</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Oh, how secure, how happy one feels in such
arms. Why didn’t I know you as a child? I am
sure I wouldn’t then even have looked at other
women.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Karl!</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>And how beautiful you are!… beautiful!…
Oh, come…</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Do you know what I am thinking of to-night?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>What, sweetheart?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Of … of … of Venice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Our first night…</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Yes…</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>What then? Tell me!</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>You love me as much to-day.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Yes, just as much.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Oh … if you would always…</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">In her arms</span>) If I would what?</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>My Karl!</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>What do you mean? If I would always?…</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Well, yes.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Well, what then, if I would always?…</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>Then I would always know that you love me.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Yes. But you must know that anyway. One
cannot always be a lover, sometimes one has to go
out into the cold world to struggle and achieve!
Don’t forget that, my child. There is a time for
everything in marriage—that is the beauty of it.
There are not many who can remember their
Venice after five years.</p>

<p class="character">Young Wife</p>

<p>True!</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>And now … good-night, my child.</p>

<h2>THE HUSBAND AND THE SWEET
YOUNG MISS</h2>

<p class="scene">A private dining-room in the Riedhof, comfortably
furnished with moderately good taste. A gas-grate
is burning. The <span class="character">Husband</span> and the <span class="character">Sweet
Young Miss</span> are disclosed. The remains of dinner
are on the table, cream-cakes, fruit, cheese. In the
wine-glasses is a Hungarian white wine.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Is smoking a Havana cigar, and leaning against
the corner of a sofa</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Sits beside him in an armchair, eating the
cream out of a cake with a spoon, and tasting it with
satisfaction</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Is it good?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Without stopping</span>) Oh!</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Do you want another?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>No. I’ve eaten too much already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Your wine is all gone.</p>

<p class="indented">(<span class="stage-direction">He fills her glass</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>No … stop. I’ll leave it anyway.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Why are you so shy?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Am I?—Well, it takes time to get acquainted.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Come and sit here with me.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Right away… I’m not ready yet.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Rises and stands behind her chair, and puts his
arms around her, turning her face toward him</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>What’s the matter?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>I want a kiss.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Kissing him</span>) You are … excuse me, you
have a lot of nerve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>You’re just finding that out?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Oh, no, I knew that long ago … from the first,
in the street.—You must—</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>You must have a nice opinion of me.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Because I went right away with you to a private
dining room.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Well, you can hardly say “right away.”</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>But you asked in such a nice way.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Do you think so?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>And, after all, what is the harm?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Of course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Whether we go walking or—</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Besides, it’s much too cold for walking.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Yes, it was too cold.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>But here it’s nice and warm, isn’t it?</p>

<p class="indented">(<span class="stage-direction">He sits down again, puts his arms
around the girl, and draws her to his side</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Weakly</span>) Don’t.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Tell me… You noticed me before, didn’t
you?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Certainly. Several blocks before you spoke to
me.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>I don’t mean to-day. I mean yesterday and the
day before, when I was following you.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>A lot of people follow me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>I don’t doubt that. But did you notice me?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Guess … do you know what happened to me
the other day? My cousin’s husband followed me
in the dark, and didn’t recognize me.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Did he speak to you?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>What do you suppose? Do you imagine every
one is as bold as you?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>But they sometimes do, don’t they?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Of course, they do.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Well, and what do you do?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Why nothing—I just don’t answer.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Hm-m … but you answered me.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Are you sorry?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Kisses her violently</span>) Your lips taste like
cream-cakes.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Oh, they are sweet by nature.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>I suppose many have told you that?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Many! What are you dreaming of?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Now, be honest. How many have kissed this
mouth before?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Why do you ask? You wouldn’t believe me anyhow,
if I told you.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Guess, then.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>All right, I’ll guess—but you mustn’t get angry!</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Why should I get angry?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Well, then, I’ll guess … twenty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Slipping away from him</span>) So—why not make
it a hundred?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Oh, I was just guessing.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>You guessed badly.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Say—ten.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Offended</span>) Oh, of course. A girl who lets a
man talk to her on the street, and goes right away
with him to a private dining-room!</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Don’t be childish. Whether we walk about in
the streets or sit in a room… We are in a
restaurant. The waiter may come in at any moment—it
doesn’t signify anything at all…</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>That’s just what I thought.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Have you ever been in a private dining-room
before?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>If I must tell the truth—yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>I am glad that you are honest with me at least.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>But it wasn’t—no it wasn’t the way you imagine.
I was in a private dining-room with a friend and
her fiancé, once during the carnival.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>It wouldn’t have been anything tragic, if you had
ever gone—with your sweetheart—</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn’t have been anything serious.
But I haven’t any sweetheart.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Oh, come now.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>I swear, I haven’t.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>But you don’t expect to make me believe that
I…</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Make you believe what?… I haven’t any—at
least, haven’t had for six months.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>I see… But before then? Who was he?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Why are you so curious?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>I am curious because I love you.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Of course! You should have noticed that. Tell
me about him.</p>

<p class="indented">(<span class="stage-direction">Presses her tightly to him</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>What do you want me to tell?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Don’t keep me in suspense so long. Who was
he, that’s what I want to know.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Laughing</span>) Just a man.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Well—well—who?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>He looked something like you.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>No!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>If you hadn’t looked so much like him—</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Well, what then?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Now, don’t ask, don’t you see that…</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Understanding</span>) That’s why you let me speak
to you.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Yes, that’s it.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>I really don’t know whether I ought to be pleased
or angry.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>If I were you, I’d be pleased.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>You also remind me of him the way you speak
… and the way you look at one…</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>What was he?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>And then, the eyes—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>What was his name?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Please don’t look at me that way; please don’t.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Embraces her. A long, burning kiss</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Trembles, and tries to get up</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Why do you want to leave me?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>It’s time to go home.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Later.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>No, I really have to get home. What do you
think mother will say.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>You live with your mother?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Of course, I live with my mother. What did you
imagine?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>So—with your mother. Do you live alone with
her?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Oh, yes, alone! There are five of us! Two
boys and two more girls.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Don’t sit so far away from me. Are you the
oldest?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>No, I’m the second. First comes Kitty. She’s
working in a flower store. Then come I.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Where do you work?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>I stay at home.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Always?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>One of us has to stay home.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Of course,—and what do you tell your mother,
when you—come home so late?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>That happens so seldom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Well, to-day, for example. Your mother will
ask you, won’t she?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Of course, she’ll ask. It doesn’t matter how
careful I am when I come home, she always wakes
up.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>And what do you tell her?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Oh—that I’ve been to the theater.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Does she believe that?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Why shouldn’t she believe it? I often go to the
theater. I saw an opera on Sunday with my friend
and her fiancé, and my oldest brother.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Where did you get the tickets?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>My brother is a hairdresser.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Oh, yes, a hairdresser … at the theater, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Why are you asking so many questions?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Because I am interested. What does your other
brother do?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>He’s still going to school. He wants to become
a teacher. Just imagine!</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>And you also have a little sister?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Yes, she is a mere child, but you have to keep
an eye on her all the time already. You have no
idea how girls are spoiled at school. Just imagine!
The other day I caught her keeping a date.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Yes! She was out walking one evening at half-past
seven with a boy from the school across the
way. A mere child like her!</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>And what did you do?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>I gave her a spanking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Are you as strict as all that?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Well, who would be if I wasn’t? My older sister
is working and mother does nothing but grumble—everything
always depends on me.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>You are a dear, sweet girl! (<span class="stage-direction">Kisses her, and
grows more tender</span>) You also remind me of some
one.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>So—of whom?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Of no one in particular … of bygone days

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>How old are you?… You … why …
I don’t even know your name.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Karl.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Is it possible? Your name is Karl?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Was his name also Karl?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>No, but that’s the queer thing … that is …
the eyes … (<span class="stage-direction">shaking her head</span>) the way you
look at me…</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>And who was he?—You haven’t told me yet.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Oh, he was a bad man—that’s sure, otherwise he
wouldn’t have gone away.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Did you love him very much?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Of course, I loved him.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>I know what he was—a lieutenant.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>No, he wasn’t in the army. He couldn’t pass the
examinations. His father owns a house in …
but why do you have to know?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Kisses her</span>) You have gray eyes. I thought,
at first, they were black.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Well aren’t they pretty enough?</p>

<p>Don’t please—I can’t bear it… O, please
don’t … let me get up … only for a moment—please.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">More tenderly still</span>) No, indeed.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>But, please, Karl…</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>How old are you?—eighteen—isn’t it?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Just past nineteen.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Nineteen … and I—</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>You are thirty…</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>And a little more—Don’t let’s talk about it.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>He was thirty-two, when I first met him.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>How long ago was that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>I don’t remember… Listen, there must have
been something in the wine.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>What makes you think so?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>I am quite … see—everything is turning
round about me.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Then hold tight to me. So… (<span class="stage-direction">He holds her
close to him, and becomes more and more tender.
She hardly resists</span>) I’ll tell you something, dear,
we might go now.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Yes … home.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Well, not exactly home…</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>What do you mean?… O, no—no… I
won’t go anywhere else. What do you think I
am?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>But listen to me, child—the next time we meet,
you know, we will arrange it so that … (<span class="stage-direction">He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
has slipped to the floor with his head in her lap</span>)
This is so comfy, oh, so comfy!</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>What are you doing? (<span class="stage-direction">She kisses his hair</span>)
Something must have been in that wine—I’m so
sleepy … what would happen, if I couldn’t get
up again? But, but—look, but Karl … if some
one should come in … please … the waiter.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>No … waiter … will ever come in …
here…</p>

<p>Yes…</p>

<p>You are quite changed. What have I done to

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Well, why don’t you make a date?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>When? First of all, I must explain that I do
not live in Vienna. I am only here for a few days’
visit now and then.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Oh, you’re not a Viennese?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Yes, I am a Viennese. But I am living out of

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Where?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Oh, well, that doesn’t matter.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Oh, don’t be frightened, I won’t come to see you.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>If it would give you any pleasure you may come.
I live in Graz.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Honestly?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Yes, why does that surprise you?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>You are married, aren’t you?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Greatly surprised</span>) What makes you think
that?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>I just got the impression.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>And you wouldn’t mind that at all?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Well, I would rather that you were single.—So
you are married!—</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>But, tell me first what made you think of that?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>If a man says he doesn’t live in Vienna, and
he doesn’t always have time—</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>But that’s not so improbable.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>I don’t believe it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>And wouldn’t it hurt your conscience to have
caused a married man to become unfaithful?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Oh, my, no doubt your wife acts just like you.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Very indignant</span>) That will do. No more of
such remarks.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>I thought you didn’t have a wife.</p>

uncalled for.</p>

<p class="indented">(<span class="stage-direction">He has risen</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>But Karl, Karl, what is the matter? Are you
angry? I really didn’t know that you were married.
I was just talking. Come, don’t be angry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Well, listen to me a minute. Let’s talk seriously.
I would like to see you again, to see you
often.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Would you?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>But one thing is necessary … that I can depend
upon you. I can’t look out for you.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Oh, I can look out for myself.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>You are … well, I can’t just say inexperienced—but,
you are young—and—men in general
are pretty unscrupulous.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Oh, my!</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>I don’t mean on the moral side only.—Well, you
know what I mean—</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Tell me, what do you think I am?</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Look here—if you want me—me only—we can
easily arrange it—even if I do generally live in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Graz. In a place like this where some one may
come in at any moment, it isn’t very comfortable.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Snuggles up to him</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Next time … we shall go somewhere else,
won’t we?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>Where we may be entirely alone.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="character">Husband</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Embracing her passionately</span>) We’ll discuss
the rest on the way home. (<span class="stage-direction">He rises, and opens

<h2>THE SWEET YOUNG MISS AND
THE POET</h2>

<p class="scene">A small room, furnished with taste and comfort.
Red curtains half-darken the room. A large writing-table
strewn with books and papers. A piano
against the wall. The <span class="character">Sweet Young Miss</span> and the
<span class="character">Poet</span> are disclosed. They are just entering. The
<span class="character">Poet</span> closes the door.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Kisses her</span>) My darling!</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">With hat and coat</span>) Oh! It’s very pretty
here! Only you can’t see anything!</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Your eyes will have to get used to this semi-darkness.—Those
sweet eyes—</p>

<p class="indented">(<span class="stage-direction">Kisses her eyes</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>But there won’t be time enough.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Because I can only stop a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>But, you can take your hat off, can’t you?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Just for the sake of a minute?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Takes the pin out of her hat which he removes</span>)</p>

<p>And your coat—</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>The idea!—I have to leave right away.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>But you must rest a while first. We have been
walking for three hours.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Riding, you mean.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Yes, we rode home—but we ran around for a
full three hours in the country. Now come, sit
down, child … wherever you like—here at my
desk;—no, that’s not comfortable. Sit down on the
sofa.—That’s it. (<span class="stage-direction">He presses her down</span>) If you
are very tired, you may as well lie down. So.
(<span class="stage-direction">He stretches her out on the sofa</span>) There, put your
head on the cushion.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Laughing</span>) But I’m not tired at all!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>You merely imagine you’re not. So—and if
you are sleepy, you can go to sleep. I shall be very
quiet. And what’s more I can play you a lullaby
… one of my own…</p>

<p class="indented">(<span class="stage-direction">He goes to the piano</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>One of yours.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>But I thought, Robert, you were a professor.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>I? But I told you I was a writer. But what
made you think of that?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Because you said the piece you are playing is
your own.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Yes … perhaps it is, perhaps it isn’t. But
that doesn’t matter. Well? Anyway it doesn’t
matter who composed it, if only it is beautiful.
Don’t you agree?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Of course … it must be beautiful … that’s
the chief thing!—</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Do you know what I meant by that?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>By what?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>By what I just said.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Sleepily</span>) Of course I do.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Gets up, goes to her, and strokes her hair</span>) You
didn’t understand a word.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>I’m not as stupid as that.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Certainly you are, but that is just the reason why
I love you. It is so beautiful, when girls are
stupid. I mean in the way you are.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Go on, you are talking nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Angel, little one! Isn’t it comfy on this soft,
Persian couch cover?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Indeed, it is. Won’t you play something else
on the piano?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>No, I’d rather stay near you.</p>

<p class="indented">(<span class="stage-direction">Caressing her</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>But hadn’t you better light the lamp?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Oh, no… The dim light is so restful. We
were as if bathed in sunbeams all day. Now we’ve
just climbed out of the bath and slipped on …
the twilight like a bathrobe—(<span class="stage-direction">Laughs</span>) No—that
ought to be expressed differently… Don’t
you think so?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>I don’t know.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Moves slightly away from her</span>) Absolutely
divine, this stupidity!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>What are you doing? (<span class="stage-direction">She turns toward him</span>)
What are you writing?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Softly</span>) Sun, bath, twilight, cloak … so…
(<span class="stage-direction">He puts the notebook back. Aloud</span>)
Nothing… Now tell me, sweetheart, wouldn’t
you like something to eat or drink?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>I’m not thirsty, but I am hungry.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Hm … it would suit me better, if you were
thirsty. I have some cognac at home, but I have
to send out for food.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Can’t you send somebody?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>That is difficult, my servant isn’t here now—but,
wait a minute—I will go myself … what would
you like?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Oh, really don’t bother; I have to go home anyway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Child, that’s out of the question. Now I will tell
you something; when we leave, we will go together
somewhere for supper.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Oh, no. I haven’t time for that. And, then,
where could we go? Somebody we know might

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Do you know such a lot of people?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Well, it takes only one to make trouble for us.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Why trouble?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Well, suppose mother should hear about it…</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>We can go somewhere, where no one can see us.
There are plenty of restaurants with private dining-rooms.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Singing</span>) “Let’s dine in a chambre separée!”</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Have you ever been in a private dining-room?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>To tell the truth—yes.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Who was the happy man?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Oh, it wasn’t the way you imagine… I went
with a friend and her fiancé. They took me along.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>And you expect me to believe that?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>You needn’t believe it!</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Close to her</span>) Did you blush? You can
hardly see anything. I can’t even distinguish your
features. (<span class="stage-direction">He touches her cheeks with his hands</span>)
But even so I recognize you.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Well, be careful that you don’t take me for some
one else.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>It is strange, I don’t seem to remember how you
look.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Seriously</span>) It is almost uncanny. I can’t
imagine any longer how you look—In a certain
way I have already forgotten you—Now, if I
couldn’t remember even the sound of your voice … what
would you do then?—Something near
and far away at the same time … it’s uncanny.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>What are you talking about?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Nothing, my angel, nothing. Where are your
lips?…</p>

<p class="indented">(<span class="stage-direction">He kisses her</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be better to light the lamp?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>No… (<span class="stage-direction">Very tenderly</span>) Tell me, do you
love me?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Very much … oh, so much!</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Have you ever loved any one as much as me?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>I told you already that I didn’t.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>He was my fiancé.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>I’d rather you wouldn’t think of him now.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Why … what’s the difference … look…</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>We might imagine now that we were in a palace
in India.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>I’m sure people there wouldn’t be as wicked as
you are.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>How idiotic! Perfectly divine—Ah, if you only
know what you are to me…</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Don’t always push me away, I’m not going to

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>My corset hurts me.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Simply</span>) Take it off.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Yes. But you must behave.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Of course!</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Rises, and takes off her corset in the darkness</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

aren’t you at all curious to know my name?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Yes, what is it?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>I’d rather not tell you my real name, but the
name I go by.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>What is the difference?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>I mean the name I use as a writer.</p>

<p>Oh, Robert.</p>

<p>And now enter into our Indian palace.</p>

<p>I adore you. (<span class="stage-direction">Kisses her passionately</span>) I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>

<p>Robert … Robert…</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was heaven… My name is…</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Robert—oh, my Robert!</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>I call myself Biebitz.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Why do you call yourself Biebitz?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>My name is not Biebitz—I just use it as a
pseudonym … well, don’t you recognize the
name?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>You don’t know the name Biebitz? Ah—Perfectly
divine! Really? You are just pretending
you don’t know it, aren’t you?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>No really, I never heard it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Don’t you ever go to the theater?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Oh, yes—I was at the opera only the other day
with—you know, with one of my friends and her
uncle, to hear Cavalleria Rusticana.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Hm, you don’t go then to see plays.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>I never get tickets for them.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>I’ll send you a ticket soon.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Oh, do! And don’t forget it. But for something
funny.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Oh … something funny … you don’t care
to see anything sad?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Not very much.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Not even if it is a play of mine.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>A play of yours? Do you write for the theater?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Let me light a candle now. I haven’t seen you
since you have become my best beloved—Angel!</p>

<p class="indented">(<span class="stage-direction">He lights a candle</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Don’t. I’m ashamed. Give me a cover at least.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Later!</p>

<p class="indented">(<span class="stage-direction">He approaches her with the light, and
looks at her a long while</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Covering her face with her hands</span>) Go away,
Robert!</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>You are beautiful, you are Beauty itself. You
are Nature herself. You are the simplicity which
is holy.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Ouch! You are dropping wax on me. Look,
why aren’t you more careful?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Puts the candle away</span>) You are that for which
I have long sought. You love me for my own sake.
You would love me even if I were only a counter-jumper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
That’s balm to one’s heart. I must confess
I was suspicious until this moment. Tell me,
honestly, you didn’t have any notion that I am Biebitz?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Oh, pshaw, I don’t even know what you are talking
about. I never heard of any Biebitz.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>What is fame! No, forget what I have told
you. Forget even the name. I am Robert and I
want to remain Robert to you. I was only joking.
(<span class="stage-direction">Lightly</span>) I am not a writer at all. I’m a clerk,
and in the evening I play the piano in a dancehall.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>But now I’m all mixed up … and the way you
look at one. What is the matter, yes, what do you
mean?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>It is very strange—something that has never happened
to me, sweetheart; I am on the verge of tears.
You move me deeply. We ought to live together.
Will you? We will be very much in love with each
other.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Is it true about the dancehall?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Yes, but don’t ask any more about it. If you
love me, don’t ask me anything. Tell me, can’t
you get away for a few weeks?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>How do you mean get away?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Well, I mean, leave home?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>How absurd! How could I! What would
mother say? And without me everything would
be topsy-turvy at home in no time.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>It would be so wonderful to live with you a few
weeks, all alone with you, somewhere far away, in
the forest, in the world of nature… Nature.
And then, some day, “Good-by”—each going,
without the other knowing where.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>You are talking already about saying good-by.
And I thought that you loved me such a lot.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>That is just the reason—(<span class="stage-direction">Bends over her, and
kisses her upon the forehead.</span>) You sweet darling!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Please, hold me tight. I feel so cold.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>I fancy it’s time for you to dress. Wait, I’ll
light a few more candles for you.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Rising</span>) Don’t look this way.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>No. (<span class="stage-direction">At the window</span>) Tell me, child, are you
happy?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>I mean are you happy the way things are in general?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Well, they might be better.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>You misunderstand me. You have told me
enough about your conditions at home. I know
you are not a princess. Leaving all that aside, do
you feel alive. Do you feel life pulsing through
you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Come, have you a comb?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Goes to the dressing-table, hands her a comb,
and watches her</span>) Good Lord, how lovely you
look!</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Please … don’t!</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Please, stay a while yet. I’ll get something for
supper, and…</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>But it is awfully late already.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>It is not yet nine.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Dear me, I must hurry. Please!</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>When shall I see you again?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>When would you like to see me?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Saturday.</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Oh, then I can’t. I must take my little sister to
her guardian.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Then Sunday … hm … Sunday … on
Sunday … now I’ll have to explain something to
you.—I’m not Biebitz, but Biebitz is a friend of
mine. I’ll introduce him to you sometime. Biebitz’s
play will be given Sunday. I’ll send you
tickets, and take you home after the performance.
You will tell me then how you liked the play.
Won’t you?</p>

<p class="character">Miss</p>

<p>Here you are talking about this Biebitz again.—I
don’t understand what it is all about.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>I won’t know you really, until I know what
impression the play made on you.</p>

<h2>THE POET AND THE
ACTRESS</h2>

<p class="scene">A room in an inn in the country. It is an evening
in spring; moonlight floods the meadows and
hills; the windows are open. A deep silence
reigns. The <span class="character">Poet</span> and the <span class="character">Actress</span> enter, and as
they cross the threshold, the candle which the <span class="character">Poet</span>
is carrying in his hand is blown out.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Oh…</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>What’s the matter?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>The candle.—But we don’t need any. Look,
how light it is. Wonderful!</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Sinks suddenly down at the window with her
hands folded</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>What’s the matter with you?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Remains silent</span>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Going to her</span>) What are you doing?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Indignant</span>) Can’t you see that I am praying?—</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Do you believe in God?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Of course I do; I am not a fool.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Oh, I see!</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Come, kneel down beside me. It will do you
good to pray just once. None of the gems will
drop out of your crown.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Kneels beside her, and puts his arm around her
waist</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Libertine!—(<span class="stage-direction">Rises</span>). And do you know to
whom I prayed?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>To God, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">With deep sarcasm</span>) Oh, of course! It was
to you to whom I prayed.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Then why did you look out of the window?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Tell me rather where you have lured me.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>But, child, it was your idea. You wanted to go
to the country—and picked out this very place.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Well, wasn’t I right?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Certainly. It’s charming here. When you consider
that we are just two hours from Vienna—complete
solitude. And delightful scenery!</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Isn’t it? If you had any real talent, this place
might inspire you to write.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Have you been here before?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Have I been here before? Indeed I have! I
have lived here for years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>With whom?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>With Dick, of course.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Oh, really!</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>How I adored that man!—</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>You’ve told me all about that already.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>I am sorry—I can go away again, if I bore you!</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>You bore me?… You can’t imagine what you
mean to me… You are a whole world in itself…
You are divine, you are a genius… You
are the simplicity which is holy… Yes, you…
But you oughtn’t to talk about Dick now.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>That was merely a slip! Well!—</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>I am glad that you feel that way.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Come, give me a kiss!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Kisses her</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>But now we had better say good night. Good
night, darling!</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>What do you mean by that?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>I mean, I am going to lie down and go to sleep.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Yes,—that’s very well, but when it comes to saying
“good night” … where do I sleep?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>There are surely a lot of other rooms in this
house.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>But they don’t appeal to me. Don’t you think
I had better light a candle now?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Lights a candle, which stands upon the dressing-table</span>)
What a charming room … and what
pious people they must be. Pictures of saints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
everywhere… It would be interesting to spend
some time among people like this … quite another
world. How little we know of the lives of
others!</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Don’t talk nonsense, but just give me the bag
from the table.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Here, beloved!</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Takes a small framed picture out of the hand-bag

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>What’s that?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>That’s the Virgin.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Do you always carry her around with you?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>She is my talisman. And now go, Robert!</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>You are joking? Can’t I help you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>No, you must go now.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>And when may I return?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>In ten minutes.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Kisses her</span>) Au revoir!</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Where will you go?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>I shall walk up and down under your window.
I love to wander about outdoors at night time. My
finest inspirations come to me that way. And
especially near you, under the breath of your longing,
I might call it … entwined in your art.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>You talk like an idiot…</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Hurt</span>) There are women who might say …
like a poet.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Oh, well, but do go now. But don’t start to flirt
with the waitress.—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Goes</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Undresses. She hears the <span class="character">Poet</span> going down
the wooden stairway, and, then hears his footsteps
below her window. As soon as she is undressed,
she goes to the window and looks down to where he
stands waiting. She calls to him in a whisper</span>)
Come!</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Comes quickly upstairs and runs toward her.
She in the meantime has gone to bed, and extinguished
the light. He locks the door</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>So, now you may sit down beside me, and tell me
a story.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Sits down on the bed beside her</span>) Hadn’t I better
close the window? Isn’t it too cold for you?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Oh, no!</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Now, what shall I tell you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Tell me to whom you are unfaithful at this moment?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>I’m sorry, I’m not unfaithful yet.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Well, if it’s any satisfaction to you, I am unfaithful
to some one too.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>So I can imagine.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>And who do you suppose it is?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>But, child, how do you expect me to know?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Guess, then.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Wait … your manager.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>My dear man, I’m not a chorus-girl.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Well, I am only guessing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Guess again.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Then it’s your leading-man … Benno—</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Nonsense! He doesn’t care for women at all
… didn’t you know that? He carries on with
his postman!</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>No, really!—</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Now come, kiss me.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Embraces her</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>But what are you doing?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Why do you torment me so?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Listen, Robert, I have a suggestion to make to
you. Come lie down in bed with me.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>I accept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Come quickly, come quickly!</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Yes … if I had had my way, I would have
been there long ago… Listen…</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>The crickets are chirping outside.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>You are crazy, child, there are no crickets here.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>But surely you hear them.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Hurry up.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Beside her</span>) Here I am.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Now lie quite still… Sh … don’t
move…</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Yes, but why?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>You would rather like to have an affair with me?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>I should think that’s obvious by now.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>There are many who would like that…</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>But it would seem that at the moment the odds are
on my side…</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Then, come, my cricket! I shall call you
“cricket” from now on.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>All right…</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Now, tell me, whom am I deceiving?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Whom?… Perhaps me…</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Child, you have softening of the brain.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Or some one … some one whom you have
never seen … some one, whom you don’t even
know, some one—who is predestined for you and
whom you will never find…</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Please don’t talk such magnificent nonsense.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>… Isn’t it strange … you too—and yet one
could think.—But no, it would destroy the best in
you, if one should … come, come—come.—</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>That’s better than acting in idiotic plays…
Don’t you think so?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Well, it seems to me, that it is a good thing you
sometimes have to act in an intelligent one.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>You conceited puppy. I suppose you are thinking
of one of your own plays again.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Yes, I am.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Seriously</span>) It is really a splendid play!</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Well, then!</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>You are a great genius, Robert!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>And you might also tell me now why you didn’t
turn up the day before yesterday. There was absolutely
nothing the matter with you.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Well, I wanted to annoy you.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>But why? What have I done to you?—</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>You were over-bearing.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>In what way?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Everybody at the theater thinks you are.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Really.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>But I told them, he has a perfect right to be
over-bearing.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>And what did they say?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>What could they say? I am not on speaking-terms
with any of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Oh, I see.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>They would like nothing better than to poison me,
every one of them. But they won’t succeed.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Don’t think now of others. Let’s be happy that
we are here together, and tell me that you love me.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>What further proof can you want?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>It’s a thing that can’t be proven anyway.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>I like that! What else do you want?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>How many are there that you have tried to convince
in this way … did you love all of them?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>No, I have loved only one.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Embraces her</span>) My…</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>My name is Robert. What can I mean to you,
if you are thinking of Dick, now?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>You are a mood of mine.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>I am pleased to know it.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Well, tell me, aren’t you proud?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Why should I be proud?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>It seems to me that you have good reason to be.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Oh, because of that.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Yes, because of that, my little cricket!—What
about the chirping? Are they still chirping?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>All the time. Don’t you hear them?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Of course, I hear them. But, child, those are
frogs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>You are wrong. Frogs croak.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Of course, they croak.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>But this is not croaking, child, this is chirping.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>You are about the most stubborn person I have
ever met. Kiss me, froggie.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Please don’t call me that. It gets on my nerves.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Well, what shall I call you?</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>My name is Robert.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Oh, but that’s stupid.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>But won’t you please call me simply by my own
name?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Well, then, Robert, give me a kiss… Ah!
(<span class="stage-direction">She kisses him</span>) Now, are you satisfied, froggie?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>May I light a cigarette?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Give me one too. (<span class="stage-direction">He takes his cigarette-case
from the dressing-table; takes two cigarettes out;
lights both, and gives her one</span>) By the way, you
haven’t said a word about my performance yesterday.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>What performance?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Well.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Oh, yes. I wasn’t at the theater.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>You are joking.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Not in the least. When you didn’t turn up the
day before, I assumed you hadn’t fully recovered
yesterday, and so I decided not to go.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>You missed something wonderful.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>It was a sensation. The people actually grew
pale.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>You saw that?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Benno said: Child, you acted divinely.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Hm!… And so ill the day before.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Indeed I was. And do you know why? Because
I felt such a longing for you.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>A little while ago you said that you stayed away
just to annoy me.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>But what do you know about my love for you?
Everything leaves you cold. And I have been delirious
for nights. In a high fever—hundred and
four degrees.</p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>Rather high for a mood.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>You call that a mood? I am dying for love of
you, and you call it a mood—?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Poet</p>

<p>And Dick…?</p>

<p>Dick?… Don’t talk to me about that galley-slave!—</p>

<h2>THE ACTRESS AND THE
COUNT</h2>

<p class="scene">The bedroom of the <span class="character">Actress</span>, luxuriously furnished.
It is midday. The curtains are still
down; a candle is burning on the dressing-table.
The <span class="character">Actress</span> is disclosed in her four-poster bed.
Many newspapers are strewn about on the cover.
The <span class="character">Count</span> in the uniform of a captain of the
Dragoons enters. He remains standing at the door.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Ah, Count.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Your mother said I might, otherwise I would
not—</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Please, come closer.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>I kiss your hand. Pardon me—when you come
in from the street … I can’t see a thing yet. So
… here we are (<span class="stage-direction">at her bed</span>). I kiss your hand.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Please sit down, Count.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Your mother said, My daughter isn’t well…
Nothing serious, I hope.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Nothing serious? I was on the verge of death.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Oh, dear, oh, dear, is it possible?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>It is very good of you to have taken the trouble
to call.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>On the verge of death! And only last night you
acted divinely.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>It was a great triumph, wasn’t it?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Tremendous!… The audience was carried
away. I won’t say anything about myself.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Thanks, for the beautiful flowers.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Nothing at all, Mademoiselle.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Indicating with her eyes a large flower-basket,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
which stands on a little table near the window</span>)
There they are.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>You were literally overwhelmed with flowers and
wreaths yesterday.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>They are still in my dressing-room. All I
brought home was your flowers.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Kissing her hand</span>) How sweet of you.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Suddenly seizes his hand, and kisses it</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>But, Mademoiselle.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Don’t be frightened, Count, it doesn’t put you
under any obligations.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>You are a strange being … a sort of a problem
almost—</p>

<p class="indented">(<span class="stage-direction">Pause</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Miss Birken, I suppose, is much less of a problem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>That little lady isn’t a problem at all, although
… I really know her only very slightly.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Oh!</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>That’s the actual truth. But you are a problem.
I’ve always had a yearning for a problem.
It’s really been a deep personal loss to me, that
until yesterday… I <em>never</em> saw you act.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Yes! You see, going to the theater is so complicated.
I am used to dining late … then
when I get there, the best part of the play is over.
Isn’t that true?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>From now on, I suppose, you will dine earlier.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>I’ve thought of that too. Or maybe I won’t dine
at all. Dining isn’t a special pleasure anyhow.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Are there any pleasures left to an old man like
you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>That’s a question I often ask myself. But I am
not an old man. There must be some other reason.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Do you think so?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Yes. Bobby, for instance, says, that I am a
philosopher. You know he means that I do too
much thinking.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Yes … thinking is a misfortune.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>I have too much time, that’s why I reflect. You
see, I’ve often thought if they would transfer me to
Vienna, things would be better. There’s diversion
here, stimulation. But at the bottom, it’s not really
very different from up there.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>What do you mean by “up there”?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Well, down there, you know, in Hungary, in the
God forsaken country towns, where I’ve been stationed
most of the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>And what did you do in Hungary?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Well, as I am telling you, military service.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Yes, but why did you stay in Hungary so long?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Oh, things happen that way.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>But it must be enough to drive one mad.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>But why? You have a lot more work there, than
here. You know, drilling recruits, breaking in
mounts … and the country really isn’t as bad
as they say. They are really quite beautiful, the
lowlands—and marvelous sunsets. Too bad I’m
not a painter, I’ve often thought if I were, I would
paint them. We had a young chap, Splany, in our
regiment, who could do it.—But, dear me, what
dull stories I am telling you.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Please go on; they are delightful!</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Do you know, the nice thing about you is the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
one can chat with you, Bobby told me all about it.
And it’s so seldom one can find any one like that.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Down there in Hungary, I suppose.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>But it’s quite the same in Vienna! People are
always the same. Where there are more of them,
the crowd is larger. That’s the whole difference.
Tell me, do you really like people?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Like them—? I hate them! I hate to look at
them. I never see any one. I’m always alone.
Nobody enters my house.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>You see, I sort of thought that you hated people.
It must often be the case with artists. If one lives
in the higher regions… Well, you are lucky,
you know at least why you live!</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Who told you that? I haven’t the slightest notion
what I’m living for!</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>But really—to be famous—to be fêted—</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Does that mean happiness?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Happiness? There really is no such thing as
happiness. All the things that people talk about
most, don’t exist … for instance, love. That’s
one of them.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>I suppose you are right.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Enjoyment … intoxication … very good,
nobody can deny them … they are something
real. Now, when I am enjoying myself … very
good, I am aware that I am enjoying myself. Or
I am intoxicated, good. That also is something
real. And when it’s over, well then it’s over.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Grandly</span>) It is over.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>But as soon as one does not, how shall I express
it, as soon as one does not give oneself up to the
moment, I mean, if one thinks of the future or the
past … well, everything is over in a moment…
Afterwards … there is sadness … before … there
is uncertainty … in a word, one
only becomes confused. Isn’t that so?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Nods with wide open eyes</span>) It seems, you have
grasped the essence of things.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>And, you see, when you have once clearly
grasped this, it really doesn’t matter whether you
live in Vienna or in the Puszta<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> or in Steinamanger.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
You see, for instance … where may I
put my cap? Yes, thank you … what were we
talking about?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>About the Puszta.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Of course. Well, as I said, there isn’t much difference,
whether I spend the evening in the officers’
mess or at the club. It’s all the same.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>And what about love?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>If you believe in it, some one will always be there
who will love you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Like Miss Birken, for example.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>I really don’t see why you always have to come
back to that little lady.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>But she’s your mistress, isn’t she?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Who says so?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Everybody knows it.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Except myself, strange to say.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>But you fought a duel on her account!</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Maybe. I was even killed without my knowing
it.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>You are a gentleman, won’t you sit closer to me?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>With pleasure.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Here. (<span class="stage-direction">She draws him to her, and passes her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
hand through his hair</span>) I knew you would come
to-day.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>How did you know?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>I knew it last night in the theater.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>You saw me from the stage, then?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>But man alive! Didn’t you notice that I acted
for you alone?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>No, really?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>I was as on wings, when I saw you sitting in the
first row.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>As on wings? On my account? I hadn’t the
slightest suspicion that you noticed me!</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Your aristocratic reserve is enough to drive one
to despair.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>But…</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>“But”!… At least, take your saber off!</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>If you permit.</p>

<p class="indented">(<span class="stage-direction">Takes it off, and leans it against the
bed</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>And now give me a kiss.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Kisses her, she clings to him</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>It would have been better if I had never seen
you.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>But this seems better to me.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Count, you are a poseur!</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>I—why?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Can’t you imagine how happy many a man would
be if he were in your place!</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>I’m perfectly happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Well, I thought happiness didn’t exist. Why do
you look at me that way? I believe you are afraid
of me, Count!</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>I told you, Mademoiselle, you are a problem.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Oh, don’t bother me with your philosophy …
come to me. And ask me for anything at all …
you can have whatever you want. You are so
handsome.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Well then, may I ask (<span class="stage-direction">kissing her hand</span>) that I
may call again this evening?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>This evening … but I have to act then.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>After the play.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>And you ask for nothing else?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>I shall ask for everything else after the play.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Hurt</span>) You can beg a long while then, you
abominable poseur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>But, see, we’ve been perfectly frank with each
other so far … it seems to me it would be so
much more beautiful after the play … much
cozier than now, when … I have a sort of feeling
the door might open any moment…</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>It does not open from the outside.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Well, you see, I have an idea one shouldn’t
lightly spoil in advance something which may be
very beautiful.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Possibly!…</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>To tell the truth, love in the morning seems rather
horrible to me.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Well—you are about the worst case of lunacy I
have ever met!</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>I am not talking about women in general …
because in general it doesn’t make any difference
anyway. But women like you … no, you may
call me a fool a hundred times over. But women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
like you … one doesn’t take them before breakfast.
And so … you know … so…</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Oh, but you are a darling!</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>You understand, what I have said, don’t you?
I sort of imagine it like…</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>How do you imagine it?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Like this… I wait for you in a carriage after
the play, then we drive somewhere for supper—</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>I am not Miss Birken.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>I didn’t mean to say you were. Only, it seems
to me, you have to be in the right sort of mood for
everything. In my case the mood doesn’t come
until supper. The most beautiful thing of all is
when we drive home together, and then…</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>And then?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>And then … well, that depends upon circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Do sit closer. Closer.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Sitting down on the bed</span>) Seems to me, that
out of the pillows comes a fragrance … mignonette—isn’t
it?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>It’s very warm in here, don’t you think so?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Bends down, and kisses her neck</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Oh, Count, that is contrary to your program.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Who said anything about “program.” I never
have any program.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Drawing him close to her</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>It really is very warm.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Do you think so? And so dark, just as if it
were evening… (<span class="stage-direction">Draws him toward her</span>) It
is evening … it is night… Close your eyes,
if there is too much light for you. Come!…
Come!…</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Offers no further resistance</span>)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>And what about atmosphere now, you poseur?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>You are a little devil.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>What a thing to say!</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Well, then an angel.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>You should have been an actor! Really! You
understand women! And do you know, what I
shall do now?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>I shall tell you that I shall never see you again.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>But why?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Never, never. You are too dangerous! You
would drive a woman mad. Here you are standing
before me, as though nothing had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>But…</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Please remember, Count, I have just given you
everything.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>I shall never forget it!</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>And what about to-night?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Well—you wanted to wait for me after the
theater?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Oh, yes, let’s say, the day after to-morrow.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>What do you mean by “the day after to-morrow”?
We were talking about to-day.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>There wouldn’t be much sense in that.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Old man!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>You don’t quite understand me. What I mean
has rather to do, how shall I express myself, rather
concerns the soul.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>What concern of mine is your soul?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Believe me, it has much to do with it. It seems
all wrong to me, this notion, that you can separate
the two.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Don’t bother me with your philosophy. If I
want any of that, I can read books.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>One never learns from books.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Very true! And that’s why you ought to wait
for me to-night. As to the soul, we will come to
some sort of an understanding, you villain!</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Well, then, if I may, I shall wait in my carriage…</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>You shall wait for me here in my home—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>… After the play.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Of course.</p>

<p class="indented">(<span class="stage-direction">He buckles on his sword</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>What are you doing?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>It seems to me it is time for me to go. For a
formal call I have stayed a bit too long as it is.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Well, this evening it shall be a formal call.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Do you think so?</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>I’ll take care of that. And now give me a last
kiss, you darling little philosopher. Here, you seducer,
you … sweet child, you seller of souls,
you … panther. (<span class="stage-direction">After she has ardently kissed
him several times, she thrusts him violently away</span>)
Count, you have done me a great honor.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Not at all, mademoiselle! (<span class="stage-direction">At the door</span>) Au
revoir.</p>

<p class="character">Actress</p>

<p>Good-by, and love to Steinamanger.</p>

<h2>THE COUNT AND THE
GIRL OF THE STREETS</h2>

<p class="scene">It is morning toward six o’clock. A poorly
furnished room with one window. The dirty yellowish
blinds are down. Tattered, greenish curtains.
On the dresser are several photographs,
and beside them a cheap woman’s hat of conspicuously
bad taste. Behind the mirror are cheap
Japanese fans. On the table over which is drawn
a reddish cover is an oil-lamp. It is burning low
with a disagreeable odor, and has a shade of yellow
paper. Beside it is a pitcher with remains of
beer, and a half-empty glass.—On the floor beside
the bed a woman’s clothes are lying in disorder.
They look as though they had just been quickly
thrown off. The <span class="character">Girl</span> lies sleeping in the bed,
breathing quietly. The <span class="character">Count</span> is lying on the sofa
fully dressed with his light overcoat on. His hat
lies on the floor at the head of the sofa.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Stirs, rubs his eyes, sits up suddenly, remains
seated, and looks around</span>) Where am I?…
Oh, yes … I actually went home with the woman,
it seems… (<span class="stage-direction">He rises quickly, notices her bed</span>)
Oh, there she is… Queer, what sort of things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
can happen, even at my age. I haven’t the faintest
notion, did they carry me up here? No…
I remember—coming into the room… I was
still awake then, or waked up … or … or
maybe it’s only the room that reminds of something?…
’Pon my soul, yes, of course … it
was yesterday I saw it… (<span class="stage-direction">Looks at his watch</span>)
What! yesterday, a couple of hours ago!—But, I
knew, that something had to happen… I felt
it in my bones … when I began to drink yesterday,
I felt that … and what has happened?…
Nothing… Or did there…? ’Pon my
soul … for … for ten years it hasn’t happened
to me that I don’t know… Well, let’s be
honest at any rate, I was drunk… If I only
knew since when… I remember perfectly when
Bobby and I went into the all-night café, and …
no, no… We left together … and then on
the way… Yes, that’s it, Bobby and I rode in
my carriage… But, why do I worry my brains
about it? It doesn’t really matter. Let’s see that
we get out of here. (<span class="stage-direction">Rises. The lamp shakes</span>)
Oh! (<span class="stage-direction">Looks at the sleeping <span class="character">Girl</span></span>) Well, she
sleeps the sleep of the just. I don’t remember anything—but
I’ll put the money on the table …
and then, good-by… (<span class="stage-direction">He stands in front of her,
and looks at her for a considerable time</span>) If I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
didn’t know what she is! (<span class="stage-direction">Studies her</span>) I’ve
known many who didn’t look as virtuous even in
their sleep. ’Pon my soul… Bobby would say
again, I’m philosophizing, but the truth is, sleep
makes all equal, so it seems to me—like its brother,
death… Hm, I should like to know, whether…
No, I’d remember that… No, no, I
dropped like a log on the sofa right away …
and nothing happened… It is unbelievable how
much alike all women sometimes look… Well,
let’s go (<span class="stage-direction">He is about to go</span>) Oh, of course.</p>

<p class="indented">(<span class="stage-direction">He takes his wallet, and is about to take
out a banknote</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Awakening</span>) Well … who’s there so early
in the morning—? (<span class="stage-direction">Recognizing him</span>) Good
morning, sonny!</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Good morning. Have a good sleep?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Stretching</span>) Oh, come here. Give me a little
kiss.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Bends down to her, considers, and draws back</span>)
I was just going…</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Going?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>It’s really about time.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>You want to go away?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Half-embarrassed</span>) Well…</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Well, good-by, you’ll come some other time.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Yes, good-by. But, won’t you give me your
hand?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Reaches out her hand from under the cover</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Takes her hand, and kisses it mechanically, and
becoming aware of it, he smiles</span>) Just as with a
princess. Besides, if one only…</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Why do you look at me that way?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>If one only sees the head, as now … anyway,
each and every one looks innocent when she first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
awakes … ’pon my soul, one might imagine almost
anything, if the kerosene didn’t smell so…</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Yes, the lamps are always a nuisance.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>How old are you really?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Well, what would you guess?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Twenty-four.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Oh, of course!</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Older?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>I’m not yet twenty.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>And how long have you been…</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>A year.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>You began early.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Better too early, than too late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Sits down upon her bed</span>) Tell me, are you
really happy?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Am I, what?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>I mean, are things going well with you?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Oh, things always go well with me.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Yes… Well, did it never occur to you that
you might become something else?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>What might I become?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Well… You are a very pretty girl. You
might take a lover, for example.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Do you imagine I haven’t any?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Yes, I know that—But I mean just one single
one, who would take care of you, so that you
wouldn’t have to go with everybody.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>I don’t go with everybody. Thank heaven, I
don’t have to. I pick those I want.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Looks around the room</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Noticing it</span>) We move downtown next month,
to the Spiegelgasse.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>We? Who?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Well, the Madam, and the couple of other girls
who live here.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>There are others—</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Next door … don’t you hear?… that is
Milly. She was in the café too.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>I hear some one snoring.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>That’s Milly. She will snore the whole day long
until ten o’clock to-night. Then she gets up, and
goes to the café.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>What an awful life!</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Of course it is. It annoys the Madam a lot.
I’m always on the streets by noon.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>What do you do on the streets at noon?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>What do you suppose I do? I’m going on my
beat then.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Oh, yes … of course… (<span class="stage-direction">Rises, takes out
his wallet, and puts a banknote on the table</span>)
Good-by!</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Going already… Good-by… Call again
soon.</p>

<p class="indented">(<span class="stage-direction">Turns on her side</span>)</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Stands still</span>) Tell me, is everything a matter
of indifference to you already?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>I mean, don’t you get pleasure out of anything
any more?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">Yawning</span>) I want to sleep.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>It’s all the same to you whether he is young or
old or whether he…</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Why do you ask?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>… Well (<span class="stage-direction">Suddenly hitting upon a thought</span>)
’pon my soul, now I know of whom you remind
me, it’s…</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Do I look like some one?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Unbelievable, unbelievable. Now please, don’t
talk, at least not for a minute… (<span class="stage-direction">Looking at
her</span>) The very same features. (<span class="stage-direction">He kisses her
suddenly on the eyes</span>), the very image.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Well…</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>’Pon my soul, it’s too bad that you … aren’t
something different… You could make your
fortune!</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>You talk just like Frank.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Who is Frank?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>The waiter in our café.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>In what way am I just like Frank?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>He is also always telling me I might make my
fortune, and wanting me to marry him.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Why don’t you?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>No thank you… I don’t want to marry, no,
not for any price… Later on, perhaps.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>The eyes … the very same eyes… Bobby
would surely call me a fool.—But I must kiss your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
eyes once more … so … and now God bless
you, now I must go.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Good-by…</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">At the door</span>) Tell me … aren’t you a bit
surprised?…</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>At what?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>That I don’t want anything of you.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>There are many men who aren’t in the mood in
the morning.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Of course… (<span class="stage-direction">To himself</span>) Absurd, that I
expect to be surprised… Well, good-by…
(<span class="stage-direction">He is near the door</span>) But really, I’m disappointed.
I ought to know that women like her care
only about money … what am I saying … it
is beautiful, that at least she doesn’t pretend;
should make one glad… (<span class="stage-direction">Aloud</span>) Do you
know, I shall come to see you again soon?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">With closed eyes</span>) All right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>When are you at home?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>I’m always at home. You only have to ask for
Leocadia.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Leocadia… All right—Well, God bless you.
(<span class="stage-direction">At the door</span>) The wine is still in my head. But
after all it is sublime… I am with a woman
like her and haven’t done anything but kiss her
eyes, because she reminded me of some one…
(<span class="stage-direction">Turns toward her</span>) Tell me, Leocadia, does it
often happen that any one leaves you in this way?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>What way?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>As I do.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>In the morning?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>No … have you ever had any one with you,—who
didn’t want anything of you?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>No, that has never happened to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Well, what do you think then? Do you think I
didn’t like you?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Why shouldn’t you like me? You liked me well
enough by night.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>I like you now, too.</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>But you liked me better last night.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>What makes you think that?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Why ask such foolish questions?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Last night … well, tell me, didn’t I drop right
down on the sofa?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Certainly … with me.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>With you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Yes, don’t you remember?</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>I did … both of us…</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>But you fell asleep right away.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Right away… So … that’s what happened?…</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>Yes, sonny. But you must have been terribly
drunk, that you don’t remember.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>So… And yet … there is a faint resemblance…
Good-by… (<span class="stage-direction">Listens</span>) …
What is the matter?</p>

<p class="character">Girl</p>

<p>The servant is up. Give her a tip as you go out.
The outside door is open, so you won’t have to give
anything to the janitor.</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>(<span class="stage-direction">In the anteroom</span>) Well… It would have
been beautiful, if I had kissed her only on the eyes.
It would have been almost an adventure… But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
it wasn’t my destiny. (<span class="stage-direction">The servant opens the
door</span>) Ah—here… Good-night.—</p>

<p class="character">Servant</p>

<p>Good morning!</p>

<p class="character">Count</p>

<p>Of course … good morning … good morning.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be

distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
